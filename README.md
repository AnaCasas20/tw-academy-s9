Hi Ana, 

I am afraid that this task is incomplete. This task required the following:

- Creating a Markdown version of the Academy Style Guide

- Uploading the Markdown version to GitHub

- Creating a PR

- Assigning their mentors as reviewers

- Working on the feedback provided by their mentors

- Merging the PR
